# REGRESSION-ECOMMERCE-PROJECT

## The project is all about the contract work with an Ecommerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come into the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

Here the Dependent feature is 'Yearly Amount Spent' and rest all are Independent Feature

## Steps to prepare model are as follows:

a) First importing basic libraries such as pandas,matplotlib,seaborn and numpy

b) Loading and Reading the Dataset

c) Then Seperating Categorical and Numeric features

d) Checking Missing values and outliers in the data

e) Doing Feature Scaling to scale down the feature 

f) Plotting various graphs and pairplots

g) We find that 'Length of Membership' is linear correlated with 'Yearly Amount Spent'

h) Applying Linear Regression and L-1 And L-2 regularizer

g) Calculating the Metrics of the model

i)Prtinting the coefficient of the model predict


So we can say that coefficient of 'Time on App' is much greater than 'Time on Website'
